# python-first-steps
Get started with Python coding &amp; best practices

Get the latest version from https://www.python.org/downloads/ & install the python shell. Btw which version to get ? there was a significant update to Python several years ago that created a big split between Python versions. So you have to choose either Python 2 or Python 3 latest version

If you have choosen to install Python 3 then default installation happens at C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36 

Next step is install IDE from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/, its my choice of IDE btw.

Btw you can still learm without local installation of python, from www.learnpython.org
